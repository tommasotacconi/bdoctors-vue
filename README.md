# BDoctors

BDoctors is a web app to help patients find a suitable doctor for their current needs.
It is a small project I started developing with my classmates during my 6 months course
in web development. Has become my code playground in the last months. This is BDoctors
frontend repository.

## Main requisites
We were given two lists of requisites. 

Technical goals:
- Client-side validation
- Payment system
- Responsive site
- Doctors research is without refresh (happens on client-side). 
	
Functional goals:
- Make doctors capable of registiring to the Web app 
- Make doctors capable of creating a personal profile
- Make visitors capable of looking up a medical doctor
- Make visitors capable of seeing doctor's details
- Make doctors capable of seeing received messages
- Make doctors capable of seeing received reviews
- Make doctors capable of sponsorize their profile
- Make doctors capable of seeing their statistics  	

Despite being a group of five people, having less than three weeks, at the end of the
development period, the app was pretty unusable, lacking a real private login procedure.
So after our final presentation, that was anyway good enough to show a complete demo app,
I have continued the development process, where first I fixed the login procedure to then
continue mainly with a complete refactor (I am still working on it, while studying ohter
topics, because is a great playground as I said).

As of now I the part that needs polishing is reponsive. From manual testing, all other
requisites are fulfilled, though I expect there are still problems, at least until I will
gain experience on how to prove an app is stable enough.
